# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis  
**End-to-End Data Analytics Project | SQL + Python + Power BI**

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

Customer churn directly impacts revenue, profitability, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).  
This project analyzes churn behavior across **7,043 telecom customers** to identify:

- Key churn drivers  
- High-risk customer segments  
- Revenue at risk  
- Data-driven retention strategies  

The analysis integrates **SQL (business queries), Python (cleaning & EDA), and Power BI (interactive dashboard)**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

> Identify the major drivers of churn and quantify financial exposure to support strategic retention planning.

Key focus areas:
- Contract type impact
- Early tenure risk
- Pricing sensitivity
- Service adoption impact
- Revenue exposure by internet type
- Behavioral churn patterns

## 🔄 Analytical Workflow

### Step 1 — Data Cleaning (Python)

- Merged 4 CSV files into unified dataset
- Standardized column names
- Filled missing values in `offer`, `internet_type`, `churn_reason`
- Dropped irrelevant columns
- Ensured consistent data types

---

### Step 2 — Feature Engineering (Python)

Created analytical segments:

- `tenure_group` → 0-12, 12-24, 24-36, 36-60, 60+ months  
- `age_group` → 18-35, 35-50, 50-65, 65-80  
- `reason_bucket` → Competitor, Pricing, Service Quality, Network Issue, Feature Gap, Other  

---

### Step 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

- Churn rate by contract type  
- Churn by tenure group  
- Revenue by internet type  
- Service add-on adoption vs churn  
- Payment method risk profiling  
- Correlation between monthly charge and churn  

---

### Step 4 — SQL Business Analysis

- Built `churn_base` view using multi-table joins  
- Wrote 21 business queries covering:
  - Demographic churn risk
  - Tenure analysis
  - Revenue at risk
  - CLTV comparison
  - Multi-factor churn combinations

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Business Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 🔴 High | Convert Month-to-Month to annual contracts | Primary churn driver |
| 🔴 High | Strengthen first 6-month onboarding | Highest churn segment |
| 🔴 High | Implement competitor counter-offer strategy | 46% churn reason |
| 🟠 Medium | Review Fiber Optic pricing | $3.0M at risk |
| 🟠 Medium | Promote premium support bundles | Reduces churn significantly |
| 🟡 Low | Launch referral rewards | High churn among 0-referral users |
| 🟡 Low | Encourage auto-pay adoption | High churn among mailed check users |
